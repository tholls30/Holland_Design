							<h4>The Problem</h4>
								<p>When SoulCycle hired me, I got placed on a team dedicated to increasing visitors' conversion rates into new customers or "riders." Upon arrival, my first order of business was to learn how the organization operated as a whole and advertised or sold the company to potential new riders. After a couple of months of learning, investigating, and user research, the team and I determined two significant entry barriers. The first issue was with the website; upon reaching the homepage, there was no mention of what SoulCycle was or what a class entailed. There was also no clear calls-to-action (CTAs) that pulled potential new riders into the sign-up process or even brought them to pertinent information about the offered classes. Secondly, if you, as a potential new rider, wanted to sign up, there was no step-by-step process to help you choose the best class for you. This was primarily a massive problem in the NYC market, with over 1000 classes to choose from for any given week.</p>
							<h4>The Process</h4>
								<p>As we began attempting to remedy these problems myself, the product manager and the engineering lead had daily conversations about what was happening and our next steps.  These conversations mainly served to keep everyone on the team informed about what was in the works and push the project forward. After determining the critical user pain points or barriers to entry, we conferred with the VP of product and marketing to ensure that everyone agreed with the core problems. As we moved forward, we had bi-weekly meetings with a  cross-functional team from all aspects of the business as we wanted to completely re-do the homepage, which as with any company, was a high profile page. We presented our findings and progress each week as we iterated on the designs in close collaboration with the marketing &  content teams. Once we had a design and information agreed upon by the cross-functional team, we performed a series of user interviews and A/B tests on the old homepage and the new one to determine if we had made it more persuasive and easier to sign up for the first time. We also received a mandate to build the new homepage on top of a CMS system, which made sense. Still, it also extended the process as we had to vet multiple vendors and iterate on the design to fit the new CMS system's engineering capabilities.</p>
							<h4>The Conclusion</h4>
								<p>Up to this point, I had primarily worked at start-up companies that were very open and communicative about creating features and designs that would further the business. Unfortunately, this was not the case at SoulCycle as it was primarily lead through politics and egos. The homepage went from something that most agreed (and research confirmed) would dramatically increase our conversion rate of new riders to a basic page with a video reel and quick message and then the footer. We managed to implement the CMS and two CTAs successfully, but at this point, I already knew this was not an organization that I wanted to stay at for the long term. Upon delivering the approved design, I decided to move out to Colorado and pursue a freelance career.</p>
							<h4>Additional Work</h4>
								<p>During my time at SoulCycle, I also helped improve the onboarding process of the iOS app by walking new users through a  multi-step wizard that helped filter down the list of possible classes available to them based on their preferences. Additionally, I also worked very closely with a few engineers and the rest of the design team to create a design system that took into account all the mediums we worked on, including all retail and marketing initiatives.</p>
