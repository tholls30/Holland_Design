							<h4>The Problem</h4>
								<p>When I was hired at SoulCycle I was placed on a team  dedicated to increasing the conversion rate of visitors into new  customers or "riders". My first order of business upon arrival was to  learn how the organization operated as whole and how they advertised or  sold the business to potential new riders. After a couple months of  learning, investigating, and user research the team and I determined  that there were two major barriers to entry. The first issue was with the  website; upon reaching the homepage there was no mention of what  SoulCycle was or what a class was like. There were also no clear  calls-to-action (CTAs) that pulled potential new riders into the sign-up  process or even brought them to pertinent information about the classes  that were offered. Secondly, if you as a potential new rider wanted to  sign up there was no step-by-step process to help you choose the best  class for you. This was especially a large problem in the NYC market  that had over 1000 classes to chose from for any given week.</p>
							<h4>The Process</h4>
								<p>As we began upon our journey of attempting to remedy these  problems myself, the product manager, and the engineering lead had daily  conversations about what was happening and what our next steps were.  This mainly served to keep everyone on the team informed about what was  in the works and to push the project forward. After determining the key  user pain points or barriers to entry we conferred with the VP of  product and marketing to make sure that everyone was in agreeance with  the core problems. As we moved forward we had bi-weekly meetings with a  cross-functional team from all aspects of the business as we wanted to  completely re-do the homepage which, as with any business, was a high  profile page. We presented our findings and progress each week as we  iterated on the designs in close collaboration with the marketing &  content teams. Once we had a design and information that was agreed upon  by the cross-functional team we performed a series of user interview  and A/B tests on the old homepage and the new one in order to determine  if we had actually made it more persuasive and easier to sign up for the  first time. Around this point we also received a mandate that the new  homepage should be built upon a CMS system which made sense, but it also  extended the process as we had to vet multiple vendors and iterate on  the design to fit the engineering capabilities of the new CMS system.</p>
							<h4>The Conclusion</h4>
								<p>Up to this point I had primarily worked at start-up companies  that were very open and communicative about creating features and  designs that would further the business. Unfortunately this was not the  case at SoulCycle as it was primarily lead through politics and egos.  The homepage went from something that most agreed (and research  confirmed) would dramatically increase our attrition rate of new riders  to basically a video reel and quick message and then the footer. We  managed to implement the CMS and two CTAs successfully, but at this point  I already knew this was not an organization that I wanted to stay at  for the long term. Upon delivering the approved design I decided to move  out to Colorado and start freelancing.</p>
							<h4>Additional Work</h4>
								<p>During my time at SoulCycle I also helped improve the  onboarding process of the iOS app by walking new users through a  multi-step wizard that helped filter down the list of possible classes  available to them based on their preferences. Additionally I also worked  very closely with a few engineers and the rest of the design team to  create a design system that took into account all the mediums we worked  on including all retail and marketing initiatives.</p>
